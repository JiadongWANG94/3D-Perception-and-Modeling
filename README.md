# 3D Perception and Modelization Class Project
# Urban accessibility diagnosis based on MLS point clouds

This is the final project of class *3D perception and modelizaiton* of SJTU-ParisTech Elite Institut of Technology held by Prof. Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud form Mines ParisTech.  
In this project, I tried to realize part of functions described in the paper *Urban accessibility diagnosis based on MLS point clouds*, including segmentation of facades, roads, curbs and objects.  
Some common technics of point cloud processing are used like cleaning and subsampling.
The code are based on some tools offered by Prof. Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud.
